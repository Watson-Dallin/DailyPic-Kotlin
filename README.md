# Overview

I made this program as a precursor to mobile development which I want to try next. I figured practicing some Kotlin was a good way to get my feet wet and prepare for Android development. I come from a background of C++ and Python so learning Kotlin was a fun little adventure because it seems like a funny halfway between the syntax and complexity of the two.

To practice I thought I'd make a terminal version of the Andriod app I want to make. This program gets a date from the computer clock and checks for an image that has that date as a name and displays it to the screen. The reason For this was to make an app that could give a creative prompt for stories, poetry, or music that wasn't simply textual. There are lots of writing prompt apps that give a short story starting sentence but I haven't seen one that displays art or photography to kickstart the imagination. That is what I wanted to make and this program is the first iteration toward that app.

> Note: I will not be providing images here on GitHub. If you want to use this program&mdash;You probably don't but that's fine&mdash;you will need to provide image files in the same folder with the format of "MM-dd.filetype" such as "10-31.png", "12-25.gif", or "02-29.jpg".

# Development Environment

I used Microsoft's lovely Visual Studio Code as my editor running on Ubuntu linux based Pop!_OS.

I wrote this in Kotlin with several Java libraries imported to handle date, file i/o, and image handling.

# Future Work

* Develop into an Android app
* Include a full year (366 days) worth of images to display
* Include a "Inspiration Help" button to show helpful little messages along with the picture to kickstart creativity.
